Shepherd is an open source testing tool for writing Rancher and Kubernetes tests. Shepherd manages interactions with the external services being tested and aids in cleaning up resources after a test is completed. 

Shepherd consists of a few core libraries used to make it easy to write homologous tests. See [extensions](https://github.com/rancher/shepherd/wiki/Concepts#extensions) and [clients](https://github.com/rancher/shepherd/wiki/Concepts#clients) for more details.

To learn more about the concepts, configurations, how to implement Shepherd to your testing project and writing your first test with Shepherd see the [wiki](https://github.com/rancher/shepherd/wiki).
